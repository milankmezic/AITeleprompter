Generic Web App UI Design Instructions
====================================

This document describes the design and UI structure for a modern web application, including the splash screen, main screen, and result (analysis) screen. It also covers light/dark mode, background colors, and button styles. Use these guidelines to create a similar look and feel in your projects.

---

1. Splash Screen
----------------
- **Layout:**
  - Centered vertically and horizontally (flexbox).
  - Large logo/title at the top, bold, with drop shadow.
  - Subtitle below the logo.
  - Prominent primary action button below the subtitle (e.g., "Get Started").
  - Optional: Link or call-to-action at the bottom center.
- **Colors:**
  - Background: Gradient (e.g., indigo to purple in light mode, gray gradients in dark mode).
  - Text: White in both modes.
- **Button Style:**
  - Rounded-full, large padding, border, semi-transparent background.
  - Hover: White background, accent text, shadow effect.
  - Dark mode: Slightly more transparent backgrounds.

2. Main Screen
--------------
- **Layout:**
  - Centered container with rounded corners, padding, and backdrop blur.
  - Title and subtitle at the top.
  - Main content area for user interaction (e.g., forms, settings, or content input).
  - Button group for navigation and primary actions.
  - Optional: Advanced settings toggle at the bottom.
- **Colors:**
  - Container: Semi-transparent white (light mode) or more transparent in dark mode.
  - Borders: Subtle, white with low opacity.
  - Text: White in both modes, input fields use dark text on light backgrounds.
- **Button Style:**
  - Consistent with splash screen: rounded, border, hover effects.
  - Primary actions use more prominent backgrounds (e.g., accent color).
- **Inputs:**
  - Rounded, subtle focus ring (accent color).
  - File and URL inputs styled for clarity if present.

3. Advanced Settings (Optional)
-------------------------------
- **Options:**
  - Dark mode toggle (switch style).
  - Font size selector (dropdown).
  - Layout or display options as needed for your app.
  - Reset to defaults button (red, rounded).
- **Switches:**
  - Custom toggle switches with animated dot and color change.

4. Result/Analysis Screen (Modal)
---------------------------------
- **Layout:**
  - Modal overlay: dark, semi-transparent background with blur.
  - Centered card with rounded corners, padding, and border.
  - Title, subtitle, and stats or summary grid.
  - Progress or accuracy bar if relevant.
  - Action buttons: Close, Repeat, or other context-appropriate actions.
- **Colors:**
  - Modal: Semi-transparent white (light/dark), white text.
  - Stat cards: Slightly more opaque backgrounds, border, hover shadow.
  - Buttons: Consistent with other screens.

5. Light/Dark Mode
------------------
- **Implementation:**
  - Use a CSS framework (e.g., TailwindCSS) with class-based dark mode.
  - Theme toggle in settings or advanced options.
  - Save preference to localStorage; default to system preference.
- **Colors:**
  - Light mode: Accent gradients, white containers, dark text in inputs.
  - Dark mode: Gray gradients, more transparent containers, white text.

6. General Styles
-----------------
- **Buttons:**
  - Rounded-full, border, transition on hover.
  - Primary: Accent backgrounds.
  - Secondary: Transparent/white backgrounds.
- **Inputs:**
  - Rounded, subtle focus ring, light backgrounds.
- **Containers:**
  - Rounded-2xl, semi-transparent, backdrop-blur, subtle border.
- **Typography:**
  - Sans-serif, large headings, readable body text.
- **Animations:**
  - Fade-in for success messages.
  - Smooth transitions for theme/background changes.

**To replicate this design:**
- Use a utility-first CSS framework (e.g., TailwindCSS) for responsive design.
- Implement screen navigation by showing/hiding divs with unique IDs or using a router.
- Use localStorage for theme and settings persistence.
- Use flexbox for centering and layout.
- Use modals for result/analysis overlays.
- Use custom CSS for toggle switches and interactive elements.

Adjust colors, spacing, and content as needed for your brand or project.
